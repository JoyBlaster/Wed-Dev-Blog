    <header>Data Attributes</header> <br>
    <p>Scripts: Other than as a separate Java Script page, the tag 'script' can also be used to be make a block for JS, added to html.</p>
    <p>HTML5 allows custom attributes to be created. (DATA-custom name) Can be used for attaching raw data and better exp.
        Variables can now be added to html5 element. EG: (a href="google.com" data-tooltip="Go to google")Google.com(/a)
        Data Attribute allows for storing data in HTML element. Attributes can be either GET or SET.
        contains() can be used to check if HTML element has specified class.

    <header>API</header><br>
    <p>AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript And XML) is a technique for loading data into a page without needing to refresh it. 
        Data is often sent in the format called JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).
        AJAX can improve user experience because user does not need to wait for page to refresh to load a portion of the page.</p>
    <p>EG of AJAX in action: Search bars guessing results as you type in query, Websites with User-generated content (like Twitter) may allow displaying information.</p>
    <p>When a browser comes across Script tag, it typically stops processing rest of page until script is loaded. (Synchronous Processing Model)
        With AJAX, browser can request data from server and once said data is requested, continue loading the rest of the page and process user actions. (Asynchronous Processing Model)
    </p>
    <p>Good Web API can increase usefulnes of website and make site interactive and more enjoyable.</p>
    <p>fetch() allows us to obtain a JSON file across the network and printing it to console. Uses one argument and returns a promise containing response.
        HTTP response, not JSON. json() must be used to extract JSON body content.
