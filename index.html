    <ol>
      <li>HTML Semantics adds meaning behind specific web contents.</li>
      <li>Allows for the creation of more intelligent applications which can process data more sensibly.</li>
      <li>Common elements: Header, Nav, Article, Section. </li>
      <li>CSS defines style of HTML.</li>
      <li>ID Attribute: Selects 1 element with the id "header".(unique) "#" = CSS id.</li>
      <li>Class Attribute:Selects elements with the class name.(not unique) Elements with attribute affected when something applied. "." = CSS class name.</li>
      <li>CSS covers the overall appearances of website, while HTML covers the contents and structure</li>

    <p><header>HTML Forms</header>
    <ol>
      <li>FORM tag: allows user input</li>
      <li>Basic inputs: Single/Multi line text, Select, Search, Hidden, Password</li>
      
      <li>Descendant Selector: A line with requirement and condition. If requirement fulfilled, carry out condition. <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Descendant_combinator'>Example</a></li>
      <li>Grouping Selector: Selects all HTML elements with same style definitions. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_selectors.asp#:~:text=The%20CSS%20Grouping%20Selector,with%20the%20same%20style%20definitions.&text=It%20will%20be%20better%20to,each%20selector%20with%20a%20comma.">Example</a></li>
      <li>Inheritance: Properties of parents are carried over to elements. <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Inheritance'>Example</a></li>
      <li>Important keyword overrides source order and specificity. (Added at end) (Might makes things messy in long run)</li>
      <li>Types of styles: Colour, Border, BG, ID/Class selector. Practice CSS Styles with <a href="https://flukeout.github.io/">CSS Diner</a></li> 
      <li>Types of Positioning: 
        <ul>
          <li>Relative (Move around relative to where they shld appear)</li>
          <li>Absolute (Offset relative to browser window)</li> 
          <li>Relative Absolute (Offset relative to where they shld appear)</li>
          <li>Fixed (Elements can't scroll with page)</li></ul> 
      <li>Flexbox: Flexbox container contains flexboxes (obviously). Children of flexboxes can be resized. Practice Flexboxes with <a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com/">Flexbox Froggy.</a></li>
      <li>Wireframes are blueprints but for apps/websites.<ul>
        <li>Low-fidelity is for starting out with the website planning.</li>
        <li>High-fidelity is for a close representation and giving the stakeholder something close to the tangible product.</li>

    <header>Putting It All Together </header> <br>
    <p>Responsive images auto-resizing based on screen size, have better performances due to resolution adjusting and provide better design control for devices.</p>
    <p>Using "max-width: 100%" prevents image from increasing in size beyond it's original size. "background-size: cover" can fit images into box.</p>
    <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-grow">Flex-grow</a> responsive unit for flexbox items. EG: flex-grow: 1%, 5% grow factor. "flex-grow: inherit" will take the earlier value of flex-grow, used to give flexboxes that wrapped around the same size as earlier flexboxes..</p>
    <p>Flex-grow EG: 6 flex items. A,B,C,F = flex-grow: 1. D,E = flex-grow: 2. Total growth value: 4x1 + 2x2 = 8 total. Each growth value is 100%/8 = 12.5%. A,B,C,D is 12.5% each, while D,E are 25% each.
    <div id="content">
      <div class="small" style="background-color:red;">A</div>
      <div class="small" style="background-color:lightblue;">B</div>
      <div class="small" style="background-color:yellow;">C</div>
      <div class="double" style="background-color:brown;">D</div>
      <div class="double" style="background-color:lightgreen;">E</div>
      <div class="small" style="background-color:brown;">F</div>
    </div></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_flex-basis.php">Flex-basis</a> assigns allocation size for items. (The initial size.)</p>
    <p>@media rule will take the size of device. Put in style tag.</p>
    <p>Git: version control system. It allows a coder to control the different versions of files in a project. It keeps track of all changes to files over time</p>

    <h3> Week 5 Dev Blog </h3>

    <header>Javascript Basics</header> <br>
    <p>Note: ECMA international maintains Javascript versions, so version names will contain ECMA.</p>
    <p><ul><li>ECMAScript5 / ES5: General baseline until recently since 2012.</li>
      <li>ECMAScript 2015 / ES6: Current baseline. Browser support is general and safe enough for all to use.</li>
      <li>ECMAScript 2016 & Beyond: Finalized annually, and continually introduces new features.</li>
    </p>
    <p>Transpilers: Allows less compatible Javascript and converts them to ES5 or any versions prior. (EG: Babel)</p>
    <p>Web browsers have Javascript consoles, and Github code space has Node.js consoles.</p> <br>

    <p>Variable: A placeholder that can store data. To make variable x, use "var x = 32;"</p>
    <p>String: Text. Use quotation marks(''). Can use different properties. EG: "the dead return".toUpperCase() gives "THE DEAD RETURN"</p>
    <p>Numbers: Numbers lol. Can be integers(whole no.), floats(decimals), but it all counts as numbers in HTML. 
      'Math' command allows user to do math with numbers. EG: Math.round(12.432) gives 12</p>
    <p>Booleans: True / False. (Must all be lowercase) Flags are booleans. Variables can be booleans.</p>
    <p>"const" are CONSTANTS. Variables made after 'const' CANNOT be changed. (Useful for creating set-in-stone variables.)</p> <br>
    
    <p>Objects: Uses {}. var anObject = {label:"value"} Redefining variable ADDS the new property to object.</p>
    <p>Arrays: Lists with fixed orders. Uses []. Can use indexing to find specific items. If number = [1,2,3], number[0] gives 1. 
      Pop to display last item, then remove it. Shift does same thing, but with first item. .splice[index,no.of items] removes specified no. of items at index. (does not leave empty spot).</p>
    <p>Whitespaces are just spaces. Javascript usually ignores them, but they make the code easier to read. Can also use different lines.</p>
    <p>Comments are sections where text added does not do anything in the code. It allows developers to provide explanations in their code, or increase readability. 
      Line comments are done with '//' and it comments out text after this.
      Block comments are done with '/*' and it comments out text until a '*/' is added.</p>
    <p>Regular Expressions: Represented with /text between dbl slashes/. Can be used to check for specific words/phrases/numbers.
      Modifiers: /text/i (Case Insensitive), /^text/i (Match against beginning of string), /text$/i (Match against end of string), /ever\$/i (\ escapes, allowing for it to check for dollar sign without counting as a command)</p>

    <p>Comparisons are done with "===", not "==" like in python. Anti-comparisons are done with "!==".</p>
    <p>Arithmetics are similar to in python, but instead of "count += 1", can also use "count ++" (Only works for 1 increment at a time).
      Similarly, "count --" can be used instead of "count -= 1" (also only works for 1 increment at a time).</p>
    <p>"&&" can be used to check multiple statements at once (basically, it's the AND command in python). EG: "animal1 === 'monkey' && animal2 === 'bear'"
      "||" can be used to check at least 1 statement (basically, it's the OR command in python).</p>
    <p>IF statments are similar to python, but statements must be done in (). Result must also be put in {}.
      EG: if (answer === true) {
        console.log("You said yes!")
      }</p>
    <p>Switch block: Like IF statments, except it tests multiple cases. (Basically an IF-ELSE statement.)
      EG:switch(answer){
        case "YES":              // If ans is YES, print "yay". Case can be used multiple times, like an ELIF.
          console.log("yay")  
          break
        default:
          console.log("bruh")    // Otherwise, print "bruh". Default is used at the end, like an ELSE.
          break
      }</p>
      <p>TYPEOF can be used to check for object type. EG: thing = "twelve";   typeof thing returns 'string'.
        Possible types: string,number,boolean,null(just means nothing).
      </p>
      <p>Note: Truthy and Falseys are AUTOMATICALLY ASSIGNING booleans, depending on the type of </p>

      <p>FOR/WHILE loops, function similarly as in python. Statements must be done in (), and results must be in {}.
        FOR loops can be sequential (counted by numerical increments) or enumerative (counted by items in object).</p>
      <p>SET: Similar to arrays, but it stores a value exactly ONCE(no repeats) and can only be altered/accessed by METHODS (no indexing).
        EG: mySet[0] === "Juno";This does not work.         mySet.add("Juno");This will add object in.       mySet.has("Juno");Will tell if item exists in set.</p>
      <p>MAP: Similar to regular objects, but preserves key order. Similar to SETs, can only be altered/accessed by METHODS.</p>
      <p>ARRAYS can be converted to SETS, and will automatically remove dupes.
        EG: let mySet = newSet(myList);   // This will create a new set based on an array.</p>

      <p>FUNCTIONS function similarly to python functions. Similar to FOR/WHILE loops, statements must be done in (), and results in {}.</p>
      <p>Scopes are where variables are defined, and what can parts of the code can access them. Scopes are either global (accessible from anywhere) or local (accessibility is more limited.)
        Global may be more convenient, but may make code extra messy and slow.
        var creates a scope determined by function in which it is defined. 
        let allows made variables to be reassigned.
        const creates unchangeable variables.</p>
      <p>"=>" is an arrow function. It is a shortcut to define functions.
        EG: let isEven = (num) => {}</p>
      <p>"...variable" will collect the rest of the objects as 1 object.
        EG: function taste(...flavors){console.log("The flavors are",flavors)}    returns "The flavors are ['choco','vanilla',strawberry']"</p>
