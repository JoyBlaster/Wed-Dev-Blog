    <header>Bootstraps</header> <br>
    <p>Created out of boredom by developers who wanted a faster way to create UI and resolve all nook and crannies imposed by different browsers. (lol)</p>
    <p>Boostrap uses: Flexbox grid for layout. rem for measurements. Device breakpoints to accomodate for diff media sizes.</p>
    <p> Bootstrap Grid system helps you to create your layout and easily build a responsive website. 
    EG (imagine <> brackets as []):<br>
    [div class="container"]       (provides a means to center and horizontally pad content of site) <br>
      [div class="row"]       (wrappers for columns. each has horizontal padding for controlling space in between) <br>
        [div class="col-sm"]      (grid columns without specified width will automatically be layout as equal width columns. column classes indicate number of columns to be used out of 12. EG: .col-4 gives 3 equal-width columns) <br>
          One of three columns<br>
        [/div]<br>
        [div class="col-sm"]<br>
          One of three columns<br>
        [/div]<br>
        [div class="col-sm"]<br>
          One of three columns<br>
        [/div]<br>
      [/div]<br>
    [/div]
    </p>
    <p>Starting with bootstraps:
      include (CSS) [link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-rbsA2VBKQhggwzxH7pPCaAqO46MgnOM80zW1RWuH61DGLwZJEdK2Kadq2F9CUG65" crossorigin="anonymous"]
      and (JS) [script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-kenU1KFdBIe4zVF0s0G1M5b4hcpxyD9F7jL+jjXkk+Q2h455rYXK/7HAuoJl+0I4" crossorigin="anonymous">[/script]</p>
    <p>Responsive img - use .img-fluid with max-width:100% and height:auto for images which scale with parent.
      Image thumbnails - use .img-thumbnail to create an image with a 1px border.
    </p>
    <p>Other components that boostraps can change: Alerts, Forms, Navbar, Video Embeds.</p>
