    <header>DOM</header> <br>
    <p>As a browser loads a website, it creates a model of the page. This model is called a DOM Tree.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Yellow: Document Node. <br>Every element, attribute, text in HTML is represented by DOM unique node. It is usually at the top of a page doc, and represents the page itself.</p>
      <li>Green: Element Node. <br>HTML elements describe HTML document structure. To access DOM Tree, start looking for element nodes. After locating nodes, a nodes attributes/text nodes can be accessed.</p>
      <li>Red: Attribute Node. <br>Stuff like ID and classes. Attribute nodes are part of an element.</p>
      <li>Purple: Text Node. <br>Once a node is accessible, the text within can be reached and modified. They cannot have children.</p>
    </ul>
