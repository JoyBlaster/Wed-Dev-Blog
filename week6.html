    <header>JS Objects</header> <br>
    <p>Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model.</p>
    <p>Literal objects: No constructers, cannot be inherited. Best as 'one-off' object (where only 1 exists). Colon separates key/value pair. For global/config objects (EG game settings)</p>
    <p>Function-based objects: Have constructers, can be inherited. Best for objects that must be used multiple times. 'this' keyword used instead of object name.</p>
