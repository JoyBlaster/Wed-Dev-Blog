    <header>RestDB & NoSQL</header> <br>
    <p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is the core of relationships in databases.</p>
    <p>NoSQL provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of unstructured databases. It can handle a huge amount of data and has a dynamic schema.</p>
    <p>NoSQL has no specific query language, and few to none relationships. However, data is stored in format of collections and documents.</p><br>

    <p class="centered">SQL vs NoSQL</p>
    <p class="centered">Best fit for data with tables and rows | Best for unstructured data</p>
    <p class="centered">Frequent updates | High write loads</p>
    <p class="centered">Better for small datasets | Better for large datasets</p>
    <p class="centered">Strong dependency on multi-row transactions | High availability in unstable env</p>
    <p class="centered">Modify large volumes of data | Location-based data</p>
